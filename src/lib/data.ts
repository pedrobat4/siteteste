      <p class="mb-4">Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl my-4 font-headline">Types of Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Copyright:</strong> This protects original works of authorship, such as books, music, and art. Copyright law gives the owner the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display the work.</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Patents:</strong> A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to decide how - or whether - the invention can be used by others.</p>
      <p><strong>Trademarks:</strong> A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Trademarks date back to ancient times when artisans used to put their signature or "mark" on their products.</p>
